    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Musician and Music Educator</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Hi! My name is Matthew. I am a guitar player from Long Island, New York. I started out life with a love for theatre and began my on-stage career performing in local and professional musicals in New York. The wind then took me to the direction of dance. I began studying ballet at School Of American Ballet at Lincoln Center at the young age of ten. After years of dance-related injuries, I decided to leave my ballet dreams behind and pursue my love of music. I enrolled in Berklee College of Music to study guitar performance and music business.  
 <br> <br>
It was there that I discovered an even more in-depth love for many different styles of music. Since my freshman year, I have spent most of my time in the practice room learning jazz standards, playing R&B, and feeling the funk!
 <br> <br>
When I put down my instrument, I love playing with my many dogs and cats, meditating, and thinking up business ideas! I am currently a student at Berklee in my last year, always working on music, rehearsing with my band, and living the dream!</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Philosophy and style</i></p><br>

 <p class="w3-justify">Music education is my passion. I have been teaching since 2018 to students of all ages and levels. First and foremost, having a fun time is my priority. Music is about love and enjoyment and I live to see my students smile. Instilling passion and drive, complimented with providing the tools for further instrumental self-exploration is my focus with his students. A lesson with me entails building a deep connection with their instrument and forming a new love and appreciation for music. 
 <br><br>
As a deeply spiritual person, I spend a lot of time studying the connection between meditation and music. The two go hand in hand the pursuit of a deep connection with music and musical studies. The connection between music and meditation improves not just musicianship but overall mindset and gratitude. It improves student retention rate and relates positively to many other aspects of a students life. Click <a href="PAPERS.html">HERE</a> to read articles that I have written regarding the techniques and benefits of this type of training and mindset.
 <br><br>
I have also done extensive research and writing on the topic of melodic development. My method for teaching improvisation to students is unique and effective. It is based in the mindset of composition, which is vastly different than the way most teachers approach improvisational education. This type of mentality is also extremely effective in diminishing anxiety regarding one's improvisation. A solo is not your time to shine, it is your time to ADD! If you wish to read more regarding this topic, click <a href="PAPERS.html">HERE</a> to read articles that I have written on melodic development and compositional improvisation.
